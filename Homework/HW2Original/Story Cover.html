		<font face="Times">Now that you know where you are, you boot up your spaceship's engines and get ready to set sail. As you peer through your ship's rear window, you notice that without your engines on, you are already moving. Also, the stars are receding away from you, which means you are going in a straight line, and not spinning. 
		<br>
		<br>
		<font face="Times">Your ship's warmed up and you’re ready to go. You do some surveying and you don't see Earth, but you do see two planets. There is one facing the rear of your ship that you're currently moving away from at a significant speed. It is smaller and closer, but you'd have to turn your ship around and burn fuel just to reset yourself to not flying backwards. The other planet is facing the front of your ship, and you’re headed straight towards it. This one is much larger and you could use its gravity to slingshot yourself around, which would save fuel. This would be resource efficient, but it would add an extra 3 months to your trip.
