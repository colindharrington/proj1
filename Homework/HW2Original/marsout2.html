			<font face="Helvetica"> You pull the lever and feel your craft launch outward towards the edge of the atmosphere. As you sail straight up, you watch the rest of your rocket dissolve in the atmosphere below you.

				<br>
			You sit back and rest as it will still be a long journey to Earth, you will have plenty of time to adjust your course along the way.

	<h3>
		<center>
			<font color="blue">
			<font face="Helvetica"> You float for many days and slowly adjust your trajectory. The space between Mars and Earth is pretty much empty so despite the intensity of your situation, you are able to remain calm and entertained during the trip. As you float closer and closer, you watch the Earth grow in the distance.

	<h3>
		<center>
			<font color="blue">
			<font face="Helvetica"> You ready your ship, and you get ready for your descent. Earth's atmosphere is much thicker meaning it will take longer to get through, but will give you much more maneuverability. As you check your gages and prepare, the Moon passes in front of Earth one last time before your descent. You double check your landing checklist one last time.
