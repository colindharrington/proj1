		<font face="Helvetica">Knowing this, you realize you were originally headed the wrong direction. You were headed towards the gas giants, (Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune, and Uranus) on the outer region of the solar system. You need to head back through the asteroid belt, and hop off Mars's gravity to slingshot once again, this time toward Earth, just one planet further. You zip around Jupiter increasing your speed, and sending you in the opposite direction from where you came. As you swing around the back of Jupiter you graze by one of its moons, titan.

		<font face="Helvetica">Many boring days pass by and you eventually make it to the asteroid belt. Because of your calculated spin around Jupiter, you've set your course to pass over the asteroid belt. You watch its rough formations pass below you, and think about how much gold there might be in each of those grey floating rocks.

		<font face="Helvetica">As Mars looms larger in the sky day by day, you prepare yourself to slingshot around a planet once again. Mars is much smaller, which will require you to skim much closer to its surface enabling you to use more of its potential energy. The trajectory is risky, but you've had a long time to do your calculations. You begin your descent towards mars, passing below one of its moons, Phobos.

		<a href="marsout2.html">Eject via your main escape pod and abandon your ship, ensuring you won't burn up in Mars's atmosphere. By doing this however, you will have to continue on your journey to earth with very little fuel.

		<a href="marsdeath2.html">Try and use the bottom of your ship as a heat shield so you can land on Mars. This would be extremely dangerous, but would allow you to purchase a new ship if you could land. Also, you have plenty of galactic currency, but you don't know how long it will take to transfer to Martian currency.
